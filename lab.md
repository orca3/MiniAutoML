# Lab quick guide

## Setup environment
> assuming you have `python` and `conda` (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed already.

1. Run `conda env list` to see if you have `orca3-lab` env already
2. If there isn't one, run `conda env create -f lab.yaml` from the root folder to create it
3. Activate `orca3-lab` conda environment by running `conda activate orca3-lab`
4. (Optional) Run `conda env update --file lab.yaml --prune` if it has been a while since you first created this 
conda environment

## Run the lab
